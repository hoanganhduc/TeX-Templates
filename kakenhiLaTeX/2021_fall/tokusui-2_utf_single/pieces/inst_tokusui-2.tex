ACTIVITIES I (Publications)'' and ``RECENT RESEARCH ACTIVITIES II (Invited Lectures and Talks,
Prizes, etc.)'' rather than using this column. (In case the Co-Investigator(s) are involved, their research achievements are also handled with the same manner.)\\
2. On showing the achievements from the past research activities in this column, a sufficient
information to identify the achievement should be given in case there are special needs to show some particular detailed research achievements such as papers, books, patents, invited talks, etc. (e.g., as for a research paper, there should be the title of the paper, authors, name of the journal, the number of the volume and pages, etc., year of publication, the bibliographic information in case of books, and so on.)\\
3. The research papers that can be cited are only those already published or accepted for
publication.\\
