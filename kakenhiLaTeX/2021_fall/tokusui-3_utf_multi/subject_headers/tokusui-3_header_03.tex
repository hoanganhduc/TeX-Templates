	As a rule, review comments from overseas researchers are solicited for a proposal submitted to the category of Specially Promoted Research. However, if the applicant considers that his/her proposal document should not be sent to overseas researchers for some reason, he/she can select ``Not Appropriate'' for the entry ``Appropriateness of Comments by Overseas Researchers'' (one of the web entry items). In that case, the applicant should give the reason of the choice within 1 page. The appropriateness of the reason of the choice will be judged by the Scientific Research Grant Committee.
