	In case the proposed research involves such issues that require obtaining consent and/or cooperation of the third party, consideration in handling of personal information, or actions related bioethics and/or biosafety (including the laws and regulations and the guidelines in the country/region(s) where the joint international research is to be conducted), the planned measures and actions for these issues should be stated within 1 page.
	
	This applies to research activities that would require approval by an internal or external ethical jury, such as research involving questionnaire surveys, interviews and/or behavior surveys (including personal histories and images) including personal information, handling of donated specimens, human genome analysis, recombinant DNA, and experimentation with animals.
	
	If the proposed research does not fall under such categories, enter ``N/A (not applicable)''.
