\maketitle

The aim of this document is to be at the same time a manual and a
sample of a \verb|.tex| file prepared in the class
\verb|cedram.cls| for submissions accepted for publication. The
class \verb|cedram| is a derivation of \verb|amsart.cls|
(version~2) implementing, among other things, the layout of the journal. Therefore all
authors already at ease with the classes of the AMS should find it
easy to adapt their source to \verb|cedram.cls|. As a
corollary, all packages whose name starts with \verb|ams| (like
\verb|amsmath| or \verb|amsfonts|) are already automatically loaded
and you don't need to call them explicitly in the
preamble\footnote{There is one exception: the package \texttt{amscd}
  is not loaded by default.}.

To compile this document (and later your article based on the same class), the
easiest way is to use LaTeXmk, either within your \LaTeX\ environment or on the
command line as
\begin{verbatim}
latexmk -pdf sample.tex
\end{verbatim}
which will take care of running \verb|pdflatex|, \verb|bibtex| and the rest as
many times as needed.

\section{The beginning}

\subsection{Metadata}

As you can see in the source file of this document, all ``metadata''
like keywords, subject numbers, authors, affiliations, email (and url)
should be in the relevant field separated by comma--space if
needed. Beware the special role played by \verb|\\| in the
\verb|address| field: it is rendered as a comma, so you should not
separate, e.g. your institution and the city by a comma, but by
\verb|\\|. Have a look at this document's \verb|address| field for
more details.

A special treatment is reserved to acknowledgement and thanks. The
class provides a field \verb|\thanks|, whose use you can see at the
bottom of this page (in a footnote). It is intended for a short
acknowledgement of funding, hospitality, grants, etc. If you have
longer and more wordy thanks that you wish to address to someone,
there is a command \verb|\longthanks| which creates a non-numbered
subsection in which you can enter your wordy thanks. It is \emph{not}
like \verb|\thanks|, so it will appear where you type it (unlike the
other command, which needs to be filled before
\verb|\begin{document}|). The journal style requires that you insert
it right before the bibliography, as it is in this very same file.


Concerning the title, apart from being of course in the field
\verb|\title{}|, all English common nouns should be lower-case, and
upper-case letters should be used only for proper names (but see the
\S \ref{en-dashes_capitals} for a discussion about capitalization of
adjectives). There is an optional field, to be entered in square
brackets, for a shorter version of the title to be used in running
headers; this, again, you see by looking at the source code of this
very document and at the top of every odd page but the first. The same
applies for authors.

\section{Pre-loaded commands}

In order to maintain uniformity about labelling and numbering of
theorems and theorem-like environments, many environments are already
defined by the class. This means that, unlike what you might be used
to doing, you \emph{should not} insert a list of commands like
\begin{verbatim}
\theoremstyle{plain}
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\newtheorem{lemma}{Lemma}
\end{verbatim}
\texttt{\dots}

\noindent\texttt{\dots}
\begin{verbatim}
\theoremstyle{remark}
\newtheorem{remark}{Remark}
\end{verbatim}
at the beginning of the file. But most probably in your document you have already a bunch of occurrences of
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{thm}
If~$xyz=0$ and~$x\neq 0$ and~$y\neq 0$ then~$z=0$.
\end{thm}
\end{verbatim}
and we are going to discuss how you can adapt your source file. The list of all environments which are defined in the class is in Appendix~\ref{apx-preloaded}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{equal} If in the class the kind of environment (say, Theorem) already exists and has the same name as in your file (as in the above example, since this is the case for \verb|thm|), then you don't have to do anything, and the outcomes will be as intended:
  \begin{thm}\label{thm:1}
   A statement. 
  \end{thm}
  \begin{prop}\label{prop:1}
   A statement. 
  \end{prop}
\item \label{equalenv} If, for instance, you called your Theorem environment \verb|satz|, so that a typical command in your source file is
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{satz}
  This template will prove useful.
\end{satz}
\end{verbatim}
  then you will receive an error. In this case you should replace the
  line in your preamble which reads
\begin{verbatim}
\newtheorem{satz}{Theorem}
or
\newtheorem{satz}{Theorem}[section]
or
\newtheorem{satz}[lemma]{Theorem}
\end{verbatim}
simply by the line
\begin{verbatim}
\equalenv{satz}{thm}
\end{verbatim}
where the first argument is the name \emph{you} gave to the
environment, and the second is the name of the environment in the
class (see next subsection).
\item \label{cdrthm} Finally, if you want to use an environment which
  does not belong to the list below (say, for instance, that you want
  an environment \verb|Subsublemma|, called by the command
  \verb|\begin{sslmma}|) you need to modify the definition so that it
    reads
\begin{verbatim}
\theoremstyle{plain} % or {definition}
\newtheorem{sslmma}[cdrthm]{Subsublemma}
\end{verbatim}
and it will look like this:
\theoremstyle{plain} % or {definition}
\newtheorem{sslmma}[cdrthm]{Subsublemma}
\begin{sslmma}
  It works
\end{sslmma}
  \end{enumerate}
  and place it \emph{after} \verb|\begin{document}|.

    Finally, of course, it is necessary that you either delete or at
    least comment out all of your definitions which fall into categories
    \ref{equal} and \ref{equalenv}.

\subsection{Three useful packages}

\subsubsection{cleveref}\label{subsubsub:cleveref}
The \verb|cleveref| package can be used to simplify cross-referencing the various environments: for instance,
it allows us to write \verb|see \cref{prop:1}| instead of~\verb|see Proposition~\ref{prop:1}|.
The command automatically detects the names of the environments and uses the plural form, along with linking
prepositions, adequately. To illustrate this, let us add a new proposition to this text.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:2}
 A statement. 
\end{prop}
Now, typing \verb|We use \cref{thm:1,prop:1,prop:2}| produces ``We use \cref{thm:1,prop:1,prop:2}''.
Please note that, when using \verb|cleveref|, the label names cannot contain commas.
To use the \verb|cleveref| package, you need to have the command

\verb|\usepackage{cleveref}|

\noindent
in the preamble of the document, as is the case here --- on line~$15$ of the source file.  (This is also where
you can load additional packages not already loaded by the style file and that you want to use.) The
configuration of the \verb|cleveref| package, on the other hand, is directly handled by the style file, so the
above command is enough (please do not add configuration commands for \verb|cleveref| in the preamble, unless
for very specific reasons explicitly mentioned to us in a cover letter).

\subsubsection{enumitem}\label{subsubsec:enumitem}
The \verb|enumitem| package is already loaded and its main point is to enhance the original capacities of
\LaTeX\ for creating lists. It mainly allows you to take care of labels properly (and, in the background,
offers a better layout when things get hard). If you want to create a list like
\begin{enumerate}
\item $3=2^2-1$ is a prime number;
\item $7=2^3-1$ is a prime number;
\item $31=2^5-1$ is a prime number.
\end{enumerate}
you can simply use \verb|\begin{enumerate}| and then let each line start with \verb|\item|, finishing with
\verb|\end{enumerate}|. Please avoid using the \verb|itemize| environment if you want increasing labels (as
above). \verb|enumitem| allows for great flexibility in the choice of labels; it suffices to add the command
\verb|[label=...]| right after the \verb|\begin{enumerate}| command (beware, it is \verb|label| and not
\verb|\label|). The three dots can be basically whatever you want: the important thing is that you add a
\emph{counter} at a certain point, namely either of the six\footnote{A bit more is allowed; see the package's
website.}
\begin{verbatim}
\roman*	\Roman*			\alph* \Alph* \arabic*
\end{verbatim}
which offer, respectively, small/capital roman numbering, small/capital (latin) alphabetic numbering, and
numbering in Arabic numerals~$1,2,3,\dotso$ For instance, we can modify the above list to the following
\begin{enumerate}[label=M\arabic*)]
\item $3=2^2-1$ is a prime number;
\item $7=2^3-1$ is a prime number;
\item $31=2^5-1$ is a prime number.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{mathtools}
Another very useful package which is automatically loaded is\linebreak \verb|mathtools|. It provides many
commands, among others extensible arrows, fine-tuned matrices and very nice treatments of \emph{paired
delimiters}, for instance in order to define a \verb|abs| command such that
\[
\verb|\abs\frac{a}{b}|\qquad\text{gives}\qquad\abs{\frac{a}{b}}
\]
but
\[
\verb|\abs*\frac{a}{b}|\qquad\text{gives}\qquad\abs*{\frac{a}{b}}.
\]
For all instructions for this package,
we refer to the well-written documentation available at
\url{http://mirrors.ircam.fr/pub/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/mathtools/mathtools.pdf}.

\section{The bibliography}

The bibliography style used for~IGT is \verb|cdraifplain| which is a minor
modification of the AMS ``plain bibliographical style''. All authors are asked
to prepare their bibliography in a \emph{separate} \verb|.bib| file. If your
file is called \verb|mynicebibliography.bib| then you should put this file in
the same folder as the \verb|.tex| file and finish your document with the lines
\begin{verbatim}
\bibliography{mynicebibliography}
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}
which is precisely the way this very sample file finishes. Of course, you will
need to upload the \verb|.bib| file along with the \verb|.tex| for our
production. Please try to keep your \verb|.bib| file as simple as possible. You
can clean it using programs such as bibtool in order to remove unused entries.
Do not use the \verb|\bibliographystyle| command as it is already contained in
the class.

Creating the \verb|.bib| file is quite standard; one easy way of doing
so is by choosing your favourite database (for example MathSciNet or Zentralblatt)
and find the \verb|bibtex| string corresponding to
the work you want to quote: then, copy-paste it. Here, some remarks
are in order. First of all, the \verb|\note{}| field is sometimes
abusively used by these databases. For instance, the \verb|bibtex|
entry for Matou{\v s}ek's \emph{Thirty-three miniatures} reads
\begin{verbatim}
  @book{Mat10Wrong,
    AUTHOR = {Matou\v{s}ek, Ji\v{r}\'{\i}},
     TITLE = {Thirty-three miniatures},
    SERIES = {Student Mathematical Library},
    VOLUME = {53},
      NOTE = {Mathematical and algorithmic applications
              of linear algebra},
 PUBLISHER = {American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI},
      YEAR = {2010},
     PAGES = {x+182},
      ISBN = {978-0-8218-4977-4},
   MRCLASS = {15-01 (05A10 05C70)},
  MRNUMBER = {2656313},
MRREVIEWER = {Torsten\ Sander},
       DOI = {10.1090/stml/053},
       URL = {https://doi.org/10.1090/stml/053},
}
\end{verbatim}
and you can easily find what went wrong by looking at the entry~\cite{Mat10Wrong} in the bibliography of this
file. The entry~\cite{Mat10Right} is correct, and it is typeset as follows
(note that the accents were also changed to follow the BibTeX syntax):
\begin{verbatim}
@book{Mat10Right,
    AUTHOR = {Matou{\v s}ek, Ji{\v r}{\'\i}},
     TITLE = {Thirty-three miniatures. {M}athematical and
              algorithmic applications of linear algebra},
    SERIES = {Student Mathematical Library},
    VOLUME = {53},
 PUBLISHER = {American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI},
      YEAR = {2010},
     PAGES = {x+182},
      ISBN = {978-0-8218-4977-4},
  MRNUMBER = {2656313},
       DOI = {10.1090/stml/053},
}
\end{verbatim}

Another reference for a book is~\cite{Die17}, an example for a journal article is~\cite{Sey81} and an example for a doctoral thesis is~\cite{Sch84}.

Speaking about bibliography, you could look at how the entry~\cite{GGS20}
is typeset in the \verb|sample.bib| file; it gives instruction on how
to obtain upper-case and accents, because if you simply write in a
bibliographical entry
\begin{verbatim}
title={Moderate deviations of subgraph counts in the
      Erd\H{o}s-R{\'e}nyi random graphs {$G(n,m)$}
      and {$G(n,p)$}},
\end{verbatim}
the result will be
\begin{quote}
Moderate deviations of subgraph counts in the
erd\H{o}s-r{\'e}nyi random graphs {$G(n,m)$} and {$G(n,p)$}.
\end{quote}
We stress here that our policy is that, as in the title, we prefer all common English nouns to be lower-case
even if in the original title the author or publisher followed a different style, as for reference~\cite{Bab15}
(see also \S~\ref{en-dashes_capitals} for a discussion about capitalization of adjectives).

Another useful command is the field \verb|eprint|: you can see it in action in reference~\cite{Bab15}. The
entry, which is ``only'' an \texttt{arXiv} submission, was typeset (in the \texttt{.bib} file, as usual!) as
\begin{verbatim}
@unpublished{Bab15,
  author =	 {Babai, L\'{a}szl\'{o}},
  title =	 {Graph isomorphism in quasipolynomial time},
  year =	 {2015},
  eprint = {1512.03547}
}
\end{verbatim}
(you can check it by yourself in the \texttt{sample.bib} file) so that you see what \verb|eprint| does. On a
one hand, it prepends \texttt{https://arxiv.org/abs/} to the reference number (which was the only typeset
argument) and, on the other, it creates a clickable link.  In case the repository hosting the preprint is not
the arXiv, you need to specify the prefix of the repository with \verb|archiveprefix = {}| (this will replace
the url of the arXiv with that of the repository). You can also use \verb|archive = {}| for providing a
repository name, but this is not displayed in the reference list. For instance, reference~\cite{BHLM07} was
typeset as
\begin{verbatim}
@unpublished{BHLM07,
  TITLE = {Algorithmic aspects of a general modular
           decomposition theory},
  AUTHOR = {Bui-Xuan, Binh-Minh  and Habib, Michel
            and Limouzy, Vincent and de Montgolfier, Fabien},
  year = {2007},
  eprint = {hal-00111235v2},
  archiveprefix = {HAL},
  archive = {https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr}
}
\end{verbatim}

For all electronic resources that have a url but don't belong to any ``repository'' like the arXiv or HAL (for
which the previous paragraph applies), the two useful fields \verb|url| and \verb|urldate| are available.
Their aim should be self-explanatory: for instance, the entry~\cite{Ham10} referring to a paper available on
MathOverflow was typeset as
\begin{verbatim}
@unpublished{Ham10,
  title = {What is the minimal size of a partial order that
           is universal for all partial orders of size $n$?},
  author = {Joel David Hamkins},
  date = {2010-05-25},
  howpublished = {MathOverflow},
  url = {https://mathoverflow.net/q/25874},
  urldate = {2024-01-26},
  year={2010},
}
\end{verbatim}

In a reference with type \verb|@article|, \verb|@inproceedings| or \verb|@incollection| (which serves to cite an
article within a book, e.g.~\cite{Alo13}), the field \verb|doi| has priority over \verb|url|. In other words,
\verb|url| is printed only if \verb|doi| is not filled. For instance, both fields are filled in
reference~\cite{Pat08}, while only the field \verb|url| is filled in reference~\cite{Lok08}.

Finally, there is a trend in electronic publishing to endow papers with a unique ID rather than continuous
page numbering to precisely locate papers within a journal. This is handled through the field
\verb|eid|, with the possible addition of the \verb|pagetotal| field. The field \verb|pages| should not
be used for these papers. See entry \verb|MoTa10| in the file \texttt{sample.bib} and~\cite{MoTa10}.

\section{En-dashes and capitals}\label{en-dashes_capitals}

We have already discussed that all nouns should be lower-case, like in the title, and upper-case should be
used only for proper names. Accordingly, we insist that all adjectives coming from a proper name be spelt with
a capital letter except from extremely common ones. Therefore we expect to find Riemannian, Euclidean,
non-Archimedean, Gaussian but abelian instead of Abelian.

Another typographical remark which often leads to difficulties is the difference between a hyphen (typeset
\verb|-|) and a en-dash (typeset \verb|--|) or em-dash (typeset \verb|---|). In particular, it is a en-dash
and not a hyphen that needs to be used to separate proper names (as in Gau\ss--Bonnet, instead of
*Gau\ss-Bonnet) and in intervals, so pp.~123--125 instead of *pp.~123-125.  On the other hand, a proper name
like Nash-Williams is correctly written with a hyphen.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\TeX\ }{TeX }hints}

We gather here some hints which might be useful when preparing your
source file.
\begin{itemize}
\item the package \verb|amsmath|, which is automatically loaded,
  provides the\linebreak command \verb|\eqref{}| which has the advantage of
  automatically inserting parenthesis around the number generated by
  \verb|\ref{}|. So, \verb|\eqref{local.lemma}| is preferred to
  \verb|(\ref{local.lemma})|.
\item In general, parenthesis in italicized text look \emph{odd (not
    to say: bad)}. Since statements of theorems, propositions,
  etc. are automatically italicized, you can use the command
  \verb|\textup{}| to repair the problem, as in

\medskip

\begin{minipage}{0.87\textwidth}
{\verb|Let~$V$ be a finite-dimensional $\mathbb{C}$-vector| \verb|space of \textup{(}even\textup{)} real dimension~$n$.|}

\medskip

{\textit{Let~$V$ be a finite-dimensional $\mathbb{C}$-vector space of \textup{(}even\textup{)} real dimension~$n$.}}

\end{minipage}
\medskip

\noindent This holds in particular for lists: if you have a list of conditions in a theorem and (wisely!) take full benefit of the \verb|enumitem| package described in Section~\ref{subsubsec:enumitem}, you want to begin your list by\\
\verb|\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]|\\
  so that your conditions will look like
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textit{\alph*)}]
\item The first,
\item the second,
\item and the last.
\end{enumerate}
which is bad! Indeed, parenthesis are again in italics. Rather, start
with

\noindent
\verb|\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*\textup{)}]|

\item \LaTeX\ commands  and mathematical symbols in titles should be endowed with a plain text replacement for
  the PDF reader, to be displayed correctly in the reader's index. We use the command \verb|texorpdfstring|, which takes the
  usual command as its first argument, and a plain text substitution for the PDF reader. For instance, the title
  of this section was typeset as
\begin{verbatim}
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\TeX\ }{TeX }hints}
\end{verbatim}

\item As a last hint, let us stress once more that \TeX~does an
  excellent job in placing spaces and organizing layout, so each time
  you use a spacing-command like \verb|\;| or \verb|\!| please
  double-check that this is a good idea. This applies in particular to
  figures, cf. Section~\ref{sec:figures}. On the other hand, since it
  is allowed to go at the line when it considers it useful, it is good
  practice to use \verb|~| before a digit, a single mathematical
  symbol, or a reference, in order to avoid having the symbol go on a line all alone:
  so, write
\begin{verbatim}
we let~$k$ be the unique even prime number.
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\section{Final remarks}

\subsection{Avoid overwriting}

Since many commands are defined in our class file, and since it is
important that the result of compiling each article is uniform, we ask
all authors to refrain from using \verb|\let| and \verb|\renewcommand|
in the preamble. Likewise, every command which might modify the
general layout, like \verb|\setlength| or \verb|\leftmargin| or the
like should be avoided.


\subsection{Figures}\label{sec:figures}

If you want to insert figures, you should resize them in a way that they don't creep into the margins (and
this, after having checked that \verb|geometry| is disabled and that you are not using a smaller font or
larger margins, otherwise they won't creep into \emph{your} margins but will in ART's). If this is not
possible, you should rotate them so that they appear in landscape mode. It is important to insert figures in a
figure environment, by using \verb|\begin{figure}| and \verb|\end{figure}|. This allows you, on a one hand, to
add a caption and to get the figure numbers, so that you can insert a \verb|\label{fig:mynicefigure}| and
refer to it. What is more important, it allows the figure to \emph{float}, so to move around for best
typographical results. It is not a good practice, in general, to force \LaTeX{} to insert figures
\emph{precisely} where you want, so please refrain from adding the option \verb|[H]| which forces \LaTeX{} to
do so: some fine-tuning of figures placement can be discussed at a later stage of production.

\appendix

\section{List of pre-loaded commands}\label{apx-preloaded}

Here we list all pre-loaded commands. Since it is an appendix, we also recall here how to create an appendix:
you should first add a line \verb|\appendix|, which instructs \LaTeX\ to switch from Arabic numbering to
alphabetic (plus other minor changes), and then you can keep on using the usual \verb|\section,\subsection|
pattern you are used to.

\subsection{Theorem-like environments}

All theorems share a single counter, which is relative to the section number (so that the first theorem of
\S~5 would be Theorem~5.1). The rationale of the naming scheme is to use the 4 first letters of the English
label.

\begin{description}
\item[Theorem] \texttt{theo}, \emph{aliases:} \texttt{thm}, \texttt{theorem},
  \emph{unnumbered version:} \texttt{theo*}, \emph{alias:} \texttt{thm*}
\item[Conjecture] \texttt{conj}, \emph{alias:} \texttt{conjecture},
  \emph{unnumbered version:} \texttt{conj*}
\item[Proposition] \texttt{prop},
  \emph{unnumbered version:} \texttt{prop*}
\item[Lemma] \texttt{lemm}, \emph{alias:} \texttt{lemma},
  \emph{unnumbered version:} \texttt{lemm*}
\item[Question] \texttt{ques},
  \emph{unnumbered version:} \texttt{ques*}
\item[Corollary] \texttt{coro},
  \emph{unnumbered version:} \texttt{coro*}
\item[Definition] \texttt{defi},
  \emph{unnumbered version:} \texttt{defi*}
\item[Notation] \texttt{nota},

\item[Example] \texttt{exam},
  \emph{unnumbered version:} \texttt{exam*}
\item[Examples] \texttt{exams},
  \emph{unnumbered version:} \texttt{exams*}
\end{description}

\begin{theo}
  Theorems, Propositions, Lemmas, Corollaries look like this: bold heading, italic text.
\end{theo}

\begin{rema}
  All the others (Definitions, Remarks, Questions, Conjectures) look like this:
  same bold heading, but upright text.
\end{rema}

\begin{rema*}[Optional argument]
All these environments can have an optional argument. Be mindful that you need to protect any closing square bracket in the argument, as it will be otherwise interpreted as the end of the argument.

E.g. \verb|\begin{theo}[see~{\cite[Thm. 9.5]{Ser98}}]|.
