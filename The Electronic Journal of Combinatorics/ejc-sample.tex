\maketitle

% E-JC papers must include an abstract. The abstract should consist of a
% succinct statement of background followed by a listing of the
% principal new results that are to be found in the paper. The abstract
% should be informative, clear, and as complete as possible. Phrases
% like "we investigate..." or "we study..." should be kept to a minimum
% in favor of "we prove that..."  or "we show that...".  Do not
% include equation numbers, unexpanded citations (such as "[23]"), or
% any other references to things in the paper that are not defined in
% the abstract. The abstract may be distributed without the rest of the
% paper so it must be entirely self-contained.  Try to include all words
% and phrases that someone might search for when looking for your paper.

\begin{abstract}
  The reconstruction conjecture states that the multiset of 
  vertex-deleted subgraphs of a graph determines the graph, provided
  it has at least 3 vertices.  This problem was independently introduced
  by Stanis\l aw Ulam (1960) and Paul Kelly (1957). In this paper,
  we prove the conjecture by elementary methods. 
  It is only necessary
  to integrate the Lenkle potential of the Broglington manifold over
  the quantum supervacillatory measure in order to reduce the set of
  possible counterexamples to a small number (less than a trillion).
  A simple computer program that implements Pipletti's classification
  theorem for torsion-free Aramaic groups with simplectic socles can

\section{Introduction}

The reconstruction conjecture states that the multiset of unlabeled
vertex-deleted subgraphs of a graph determines the graph, provided it
has at least three vertices.  This problem was independently introduced
by Ulam~\cite{Ulam} and Kelly~\cite{Kelly}.  The reconstruction
conjecture is widely studied
\cite{Bollobas,FGH,HHRT,KSU,Stockmeyer,WS} and is very interesting
because it is. See \cite{BH} for more about the
reconstruction conjecture.

\begin{definition} 
  A graph is \emph{fabulous} if \emph{rest of definition here}.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  \label{Thm:FabGraphs}
  All planar graphs are fabulous.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose on the contrary that some planar graph is not fabulous.
  Then we have a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\section{Broglington Manifolds}

This section describes background information about Broglington
Manifolds.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:Technical}
  Broglington manifolds are abundant.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  A proof is given here.
\end{proof}

\section{Proof of Theorem~\ref{Thm:FabGraphs}}

In this section we complete the proof of Theorem~\ref{Thm:FabGraphs}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{Thm:FabGraphs}]
Let $G$ be a graph. We have
 % The align environment for multi-line equations is defined in the amsmath package.
  \begin{align}
    |X| &= a+b+c \nonumber\\
         &= \alpha\beta\gamma.
  \end{align}
  This completes the proof of Theorem~\ref{Thm:FabGraphs}.
\end{proof}
